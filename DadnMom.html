<p>My Dad and Mom are almost located in one place are in tondo, manila. 
Way back on their teenage days my dad has good sporting in basketball until one day they have a basketball league in the barangay so he's one of the part of some team. 
Then my mom was working student before, she's student at the morning and after schooling she's saleslady at SM Sta. Mesa. Let's move forward, during the league. Exactly my mom have a rest day so they watch the game with their sisters. In the time of the event my dad was on the game and he suddenly saw my mom standing, cheering, and shouting because the older brother of my mom was joining too but in the opposite team with my dad. so papa told me that was the first sight my mom and he can't denied that was a love at first sight too.</p>
